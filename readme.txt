The Review Block for Yelp makes it easy for you to display your Yelp reviews and business information on your WordPress website with a simple and intuitive Gutenberg block.

== Description ==
This free Yelp reviews block displays your Yelp business information and reviews on your website. You can find the block through the block library search or directly on the WordPress plugin repository. 

=== ✨ Reviews Block for Yelp Features ===
Our Yelp reviews block includes a variety of options to customize how your Yelp information is displayed. 

First, search for the business by name and location directly in the block. 

Then, choose from the block options to display or hide your: 

* Header with three images, aggregate rating, price point, and general business information 
* Write a Review button 
* Detailed business information, such as contact, hours, tags, and directions
* Three highlighted reviews 

=== ⭐ WP Business Reviews ===
While the Reviews Block for Yelp can help you display your Yelp reviews on your website for free, we have an even better solution for you! 

*WP Business Reviews* is a **significant upgrade** to our free reviews blocks for Google and Yelp. With WP Business Reviews (WPBR), you can display reviews from many platforms, including:

* Google 
* Yelp 
* Facebook 
* WooCommerce 
* Zomato 
* Trustpilot 

When you use WP Business Reviews, you also gain more control over the style of your displayed reviews as well as which reviews you show. WPBR also allows you to mix and match your reviews across platforms. So, your Google and WooCommerce reviews can be displayed right alongside your Facebook and Yelp reviews.
